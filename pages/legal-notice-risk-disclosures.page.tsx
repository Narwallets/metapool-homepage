          This Legal Notice and Risk Disclosure Statement (the “<b>Notice</b>
          ”) is provided by Narwallets (collectively with its affiliates, “
          <b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”, “<b>us</b>” or “<b>Narwallets</b>”). Any
          statements and representations made by Narwallets or on its behalf,
          and any use of the $META token or Meta Pool platform, as defined
          below, shall be subject to this Notice. Please read this Notice
          carefully before using or interacting with the Meta Pool platform,
          Meta Pool protocol, or $META token. Meta Pool platform (the “
          <b>Meta Pool platform</b>”) is a web-based user interface to the Meta
          Pool protocol – a decentralised autonomous smart-contract system
          implemented on the NEAR blockchain, and other blockchain networks on
          which Meta Pool protocol can be implemented from time to time (the “
          <b>Meta Pool protocol</b>”). Meta Pool platform can be accessed
          through the respective subdomains of our Website, as defined below,
          such as, for example,http://metapool.narwallets.com/.

          from the CLE. Assets contributed to the CLE cannot be redeemed or

              platform, Meta Pool protocol, and related software follow the
              high-security standards, we do not warrant or represent that the
              Meta Pool platform and Meta Pool protocol are secure or safe, or
              protected from fishing, malware or other malicious attacks.
              Further, Meta Pool platform, Meta Pool protocol, and related
              software may contain weaknesses, bugs, vulnerabilities, viruses or
              other defects which may have a material adverse effect on the
              operation of the Meta Pool platform, Meta Pool protocol, or may
              lead to losses and damages for you, other users of Meta Pool
              platform, Meta Pool protocol or third persons.

                <b>Risk Inherent in the Blockchain</b>
              </div>
              Meta Pool protocol is or will be deployed on the NEAR blockchain
              main network, and later may be deployed on other blockchains. As a
              result, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of such
              blockchain(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Meta Pool
              platform or Meta Pool protocol. Moreover, advances in
              cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of
              quantum computing, could present risks to the Meta Pool platform,
              Meta Pool protocol, and related blockchain software by rendering
              ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins
              the blockchain. The smart-contract concept, the underlying
              software application and software platform (i.e., NEAR or other
              blockchain) are still in an early development stage and unproven.
              Although it is very unlikely, the blockchain, as well as any other
              blockchain, can be attacked which may result in downtime,
              consensus split, long reorganization of the chain, 51 percent
              attack, or other adverse outcomes each of which may lead to
              complete loss of your digital assets.

              violation of logic which underpins the smart-contracts, which can
